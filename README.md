# laravel-remd-landing
Laravel remd default landing page

## Usage
Use it like this: `view('your-package-name::myView')`. Of course, you can also use subdirectories to organise your views. A view located at ``<package root>/resources/views/subdirectory/myOtherView.blade.php` can be used with `view('your-package-name::subdirectory.myOtherView')`.
